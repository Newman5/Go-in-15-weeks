## Day 1 Fundamentals

This week covers the foundational concepts needed to start writing Go programs.

### Core Concepts Learned

**Compilation and Execution**
- Go is a compiled language that produces native executables (binaries).
- Compilation happens at compile time to check code correctness; runtime is when the program executes.
- A binary/executable runs directly on the OS without an interpreter.

**Running Code**
- `go run` compiles and runs immediately (no saved binary).
- `go build` compiles and produces a reusable executable.

**Program Structure**
- A Go program must use `package main` to be executable.
- `func main()` is the single entry point; it takes no arguments and returns nothing.
- Programs communicate via side effects (printing, files, network), not return values.
- Go code is organized into packages; all `.go` files in a directory form one package.

**Types and Variables**
- Variables are statically typed; types are fixed at compile time.
- `var` declares explicitly; `:=` declares + assigns inside functions only.
- Basic types learned: `int`, `string`, `bool`.

**Control Flow**
- `if` requires a boolean condition; no truthy/falsy values.
- `for` is the only loop construct (classic, while-style, infinite).
- `for` init/condition/post each allow exactly one expression.

**Code Standards**
- Go enforces formatting via `gofmt` / `go fmt`.
- `gofmt` enforces structure, not personal spacing preferences.

**Modules**
- A Go module is a directory with a `go.mod` file.
- `go mod init` is run once per project; optional for throwaway snippets.

## Day 2: Core Go Building Blocks

**Functions**
- Functions can be defined outside `main`; `main` should only orchestrate.
- Functions can return multiple values.
- Errors are ordinary return values; `nil` means no error.

**Collections**
- A group of values of the same type can be created using `[]T{...}`.
- `len(x)` returns how many values are in a group.
- Repetition over a group uses `for _, v := range group`.
- `_` is used to ignore a value you don't need.

**Design Patterns**
- Functions should return early when an error occurs.
- Empty input must be handled explicitly.
- Multiple results (count, sum, min, max) can be computed in a single loop.
- Logic belongs in functions; printing belongs in `main`.
