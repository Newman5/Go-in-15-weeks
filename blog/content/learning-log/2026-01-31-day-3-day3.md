DAY 3 — Structs and Modeling Data (One Concept at a Time)

Goal (End of Day 3)
- Understand what a struct is
- Create and use structs
- Pass structs to functions
- Understand value vs pointer usage at a basic level
- Model simple real-world data in Go

--------------------------------------------------
1. What a Struct Is

Concept
- A struct groups related values under one name

Example
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

Rules
- Fields have names and types
- Field order matters for readability, not access
- Structs define shape, not behavior

Exercise
- Define a struct representing a Book (title, author, pages)

--------------------------------------------------
2. Creating and Using Struct Values

Concepts
- Struct literals
- Accessing fields with dot notation

Example
p := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
fmt.Println(p.Name)

Rules
- Field names must match the struct definition
- Unspecified fields get zero values

Exercise
- Create a Book value and print its fields

--------------------------------------------------
3. Passing Structs to Functions

Concepts
- Structs can be passed like any other value
- Functions can return structs

Example
func printPerson(p Person) {
    fmt.Println(p.Name, p.Age)
}

Exercise
- Write a function that takes a Book and returns a formatted string

--------------------------------------------------
4. Pointers to Structs (Intro Only)

Concepts
- Using *T to avoid copying large structs
- Modifying struct fields via pointers

Example
func birthday(p *Person) {
    p.Age += 1
}

Rules
- Use pointers when a function needs to modify the struct
- Go handles pointer dereferencing automatically for structs

Exercise
- Write a function that increments the page count of a Book

--------------------------------------------------
5. Mini Program (Mandatory)

Program: Library Item

Requirements
- Define a struct for an item (ID, Name, Count)
- Create a slice of items
- Write a function that updates Count by ID
- Handle missing ID with an error

--------------------------------------------------
Exit Criteria (Must All Be True)

- Defined at least one struct
- Created struct values correctly
- Passed structs to functions
- Used a pointer to modify a struct
- Program compiles and runs cleanly

--------------------------------------------------
Day 4 Preview

- Methods on structs
- Value vs pointer receivers
- Attaching behavior to data
