# This script will:
# 1. Count total posts and drafts
# 2. Calculate total words and average per post
# 3. Show posts grouped by year
# 4. Show top tags with counts
# 5. List the 5 most recent posts

# COUNT POSTS AND DRAFTS
# ============================================
# Use find to count files, then wc to count the lines
# Each line from find is one file

# Count published posts
# find searches for files
#   content/learning-log/ = directory to search
#   -name "*.md" = files ending with .md
# wc -l counts lines (one per file)
post_count=$(find content/learning-log/ -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

# Count drafts
draft_count=$(find content/drafts/ -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
